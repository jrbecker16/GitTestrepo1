# GitTestrepo1
This is a test to see if I can do this all the way through with PyCharm.   
Need to 
1) clone to my hard drive 
2) open in PyCharm
3) create a Branch to work on - do some work
4) push the branch up to GitHub
5) Close PyCharm
6) reopen PyCharm and work on branch
7) merge branch to local master
8) push local master up to GitHub
9) delete branches
